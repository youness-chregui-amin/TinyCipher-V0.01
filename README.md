# 🔐 TinyCipher v0.01 (C++)

This is a small C++ project from *Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud – ProgramingAdvices* course (Problem #18: C++ Basics to Advanced).  

The program implements a simple encryption and decryption mechanism (similar to Caesar Cipher) by adding or subtracting a numeric *key* to each character in the text.  

## ⚡ Features
- 📝 Get text input from the user  
- 🔒 Encrypt text using a numeric *key*  
- 🔓 Decrypt text using the same key  
- 🧭 Simple menu to choose between encryption and decryption  

## 🖥 How it works
1. Run the program  
2. Choose one option:  
   - *1* → Encrypt text  
   - *2* → Decrypt text  
3. Enter the encryption key (number)  
4. Enter the text (original or encrypted)  
5. The program will output the result  

## 📌 Example

===== MENU =====

1. Encrypt text
2. Decrypt text Your choice: 1
3. Enter encryption key (number): 3
4. Enter original text: hello
5. Encrypted text: khoor
