# TinyCipher v0.01 (C++)

This is a small C++ project from *Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud – ProgramingAdvices* course (Problem #18: C++ Basics to Advanced).  

The program implements a simple encryption and decryption mechanism (similar to Caesar Cipher) by adding or subtracting a numeric *key* to each character in the text.  

##   Features
-    Get text input from the user  
-    Encrypt text using a numeric *key*  
-    Decrypt text using the same key  
-    Simple menu to choose between encryption and decryption  

##   How it works
1. Run the program  
2. Choose one option:  
   - *1* → Encrypt text  
   - *2* → Decrypt text  
3. Enter the encryption key (number)  
4. Enter the text (original or encrypted)  
5. The program will output the result  

## 📌 Example

===== MENU =====

1. Encrypt text
2. Decrypt text Your choice: 1
3. Enter encryption key (number): 3
4. Enter original text: hello
5. Encrypted text: khoor
